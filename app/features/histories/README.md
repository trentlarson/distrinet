Distributed Family Histories

Keep your own histories, and leverage the distributed genealogy to track and search through stories of your ancestry.

- Simply add a folder (or file) with a URI prefixed with "histories:" into the "distrinet settings", then you'll go to the "histories" part of this app and see folders which you can search and browse and see links to other sources.

- To add add IDs and semantics to histories, follow the instructions at [FamilyHistories.info](http://FamilyHistories.info) under "Indexing".
