# Distributed Family Histories

Keep your own histories, and leverage the distributed genealogy to track and search through stories of your ancestry.

To get started quickly, see the main [README](../../../README.md).


## Next Plans

See [tasks.yml](tasks.yml)


## Technicalities

- Add a folder (or file) with a URI prefixed with "histories:" into the "distrinet settings", then you'll go to the "histories" part of this app and see folders which you can search and browse and see links to other sources.

- To add add IDs and semantics to histories, follow the instructions at [FamilyHistories.info](http://FamilyHistories.info) under "Indexing".


## Test

- Optional: use the "Test Settings" from the Settings page.

- Expand the list of files and then open and drag.

- Inspect a file with a link (eg. "beverly-hillbillies.html", see that "Jed" is highlighted, you can click and open at fandom.com, and you can click and open in the genealogy view.
