  - 1 Determine a workflow for seeing priorities and interest - maybe it's just looking at the priority order and blocked tasks in all projects shared by other people
    - type:bug the new Report - Find Top Links persists even when going to a different task list
    - type:bug entering a focus on one of the test workweek tasks doesn't highlight the task
    - plan how to see people
  - -1 allow selection of units for estimates (eg. 2^x, hours, days)
  - -1 when showing a project, put 'reload' and 'forecast' (and others?) next to that project title (and not in a column)
  - 1 Add parsing of a global tag for the list, eg "--- !<tag:trentlarson.com,2020:/distrinet/tasks>". See the first line of the invoice example here - https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2761803
  - -1 test for suffixes of 'yaml' or 'yml' on drag-drop import
  - 70 1 add markdown parsing id:markdown :
    blocks: [ ref:joplin ]
  - 70 1 test with Joplin id:joplin
  - 70 0 expand dependents in top list (and avoid "Empty or mismatched" error)
  - 70 -1 look into subtasks for labels to make available
  - 70 0 show something different than ID for dependent tasks
  - 65 0 parse subtasks-colon and blocks-colon as multiple label values, and make additive eg with "subtasks:a-task"
  - 60 1 when browsing external lists, detect internal task URLs
  - 60 0 handle forecasting errors more gracefully (endorser.ch empty, Distrinet integer, Histories summary)
  - 60 0 make forecast load async (and see why it reloads on project screen exit and reentry)
  - 60 0 show where a task fits in with the rest (ie. focus on it in the forecast)
  - 60 0 add project/epic/awaits parsing plus-supertasks or supertasks-key id:supertasks
  - 60 0 add ID to YamlTask and allow it to be null? (Controversial because it's not part of the original data, and IDs should probably be generated for each use case.)
  - 1 show items with the biggest estimates that include subtask estimates
  - domains - Project Search, Forecast Generation
  - 55 1 handle when subtasks/dependents are missing
  - 55 -1 change well-known "key:value" keys to constants
  - 55 0 move 'ref' processing to parse YAML?
  - 55 0 figure out why trying to show taskyaml.org/tasks.yml on 2020-11-26 fails on null uiTree in areLinkedTasksExpanded
  - 2 ask if they'd like to share on a search service :
    - Kibana? Solr?
    - server that only accepts IDs & public URLs, then loads that into file for search (check for yaml? size?)
    - modal upon drag-drop to send data to server
  - -1 refactor retrieveAllTasks to return Records instead of one large list
  - 50 -1 automatically create supertask if it doesn't exist
  - >-
    50 1 write public page to show task priorities +collaborate +collaborate-genealogy +collaborate-projects
    id:public-task-page
  - 50 1 fix the definition to have blocks/awaits/subtasks/supertasks be keys (not nested lists), with tests
  - 50 1 Define a master project file that contains pointers to all task repos.
  - 45 0 fix jsx-ally ignores (for accessibility)
  - 45 0 handle more task YAML variations (eg. blocked & child issues)
  - 45 1 work off SQLite

  - 1 parse Orlin's project supertasks:supertasks
