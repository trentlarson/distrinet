  - 01 filter for all items by due date, recursively
  - 01 type:bug drag a file but release in screen and it complains infinitely
  - 02 Determine a workflow for seeing priorities and interest - maybe it's just looking at the priority order and blocked tasks in all projects shared by other people :
    - type:bug entering a focus on one of the test workweek tasks doesn't highlight the task (another example: link from All My Personal to task-lists#markdown)
    - should clear the filters
    - plan how to see people
    - stand up public page that inputs settings and renders project exploration screen
      ... write public page to show task priorities +collaborate +collaborate-genealogy +collaborate-projects id:public-task-page

  - .5 when showing a project, put 'reload' and 'forecast' (and others?) next to that project title (and not in a column)
  - 02 Add parsing of a global tag for the list, eg "--- !<tag:trentlarson.com,2020:/distrinet/tasks>". See the first line of the invoice example here - https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2761803
  - .5 test for suffixes of 'yaml' or 'yml' on drag-drop import
  - 70 02 add markdown parsing id:markdown :
    blocks: [ ref:joplin ]
  - 70 02 test with Joplin id:joplin
  - 70 01 expand dependents in top list (and avoid "Empty or mismatched" error)
  - 70 .5 look into subtasks for labels to make available
  - 70 01 show something different than ID for dependent tasks
  - 65 01 parse subtasks-colon and blocks-colon as multiple label values, and make additive eg with "subtasks:a-task"
  - 60 02 when browsing external lists, detect internal task URLs
  - 60 01 handle forecasting errors more gracefully (endorser.ch empty, Distrinet integer, Histories summary)
  - 60 01 make forecast load async (and see why it reloads on project screen exit and reentry)
  - 60 01 show where a task fits in with the rest (ie. focus on it in the forecast)
  - 60 01 add project/epic/awaits parsing plus-supertasks or supertasks-key id:supertasks
  - 60 01 add ID to YamlTask and allow it to be null? (Controversial because it's not part of the original data, and IDs should probably be generated for each use case.)
  - 02 show items with the biggest estimates that include subtask estimates
  - domains - Project Search, Forecast Generation
  - 55 02 handle when subtasks/dependents are missing
  - 55 .5 change well-known "key:value" keys to constants
  - 55 01 move 'ref' processing to parse YAML?
  - 55 01 figure out why trying to show taskyaml.org/tasks.yml on 2020-11-26 fails on null uiTree in areLinkedTasksExpanded
  - 04 ask if they'd like to share on a search service :
    - Kibana? Solr?
    - server that only accepts IDs & public URLs, then loads that into file for search (check for yaml? size?)
    - modal upon drag-drop to send data to server
  - .5 refactor retrieveAllTasks to return Records instead of one large list
  - 50 .5 automatically create supertask if it doesn't exist
  - 50 02 fix the definition to have blocks/awaits/subtasks/supertasks be keys (not nested lists), with tests
  - 50 02 Define a master project file that contains pointers to all task repos.
  - 45 01 fix jsx-ally ignores (for accessibility)
  - 45 01 handle more task YAML variations (eg. blocked & child issues)
  - 45 02 work off SQLite

  - 02 parse Orlin's project supertasks:supertasks
