  - 70 1 add markdown parsing id:markdown:
    blocks: joplin
  - 70 1 test with Joplin id:joplin
  - 70 0 expand dependents in top list (and avoid "Empty or mismatched" error)
  - 70 0 show labels for subtasks
  - 70 0 show something different than ID for dependent tasks
  - 65 0 parse subtasks-colon and blocks-colon as multiple label values, and make additive eg with "subtasks:a-task"
  - 60 1 when browsing external lists, detect internal task URLs
  - 60 0 handle forecasting errors more gracefully (endorser.ch empty, Distrinet integer, Histories summary)
  - 60 0 show where a task fits in with the rest (ie. focus on it in the forecast)
  - 60 0 add project/epic/awaits parsing plus-supertasks or supertasks-key id:supertasks
  - 60 0 add ID to YamlTask and allow it to be null? (Controversial because it's not part of the original data, and IDs should probably be generated for each use case.)
  - Add parsing of a global tag for the, eg "--- !<tag:trentlarson.com,2020:/distrinet/tasks>". See the first line of the invoice example here - https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2761803
