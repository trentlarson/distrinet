  - show example with public & private data (eg. Misbach & Larson)
    - use data we've sync'd - click on Matt or Grant to recenter, expand parents
  - release for Matt

  - remove 'View Profile' link & icons
  - allow drag-and-drop for genealogy
  - release for Sharon & Janell

  - get sample to work for gedcomx:my-local-test:test-sample-norman#elinora
  - add a "clear cached identities" button for testing; may want to export identities
  - '95 1 make it so that directory URIs work id:#dir-path-uris +genealogy +collaborate'
    - on a file:///, want to see a link back from the public so add to the MapperBetweenSets when pasting it in
  - otherLocations is currently inside 'links' (at top level of person) but those are all this format - https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/types/json_HypermediaEnabledData ... so change to a Link type or use 'identifiers' instead - https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/types/json_Subject id:other-locations

  - pass gedcomx & gedcomxContext to getTrees2 to avoid duplicate parsing
  - figure out why api.familysearch URLs work but www.familysearch URLs don't

    93 0 determine problem with parsing JSON on private, eg.
    gedcomx:b2555240-d918-11ea-b21a-5d9a954c8137#norman
  - 90 1 add spinner when loading a new tree
  - '90 1 add tests - find, globalUriForResource, globalUriForId'
  - >-
    90 1 bug - sometimes the graph doesn't show after pasting the URL (after
    cache reload?)
  - for fragments, in getTree2 only make another file/API call if looking into a different base URI (since the data will already be in the current context)
  - >-
    90 1 bug - clicking on otherLocationResource in the same page (repeatedly?)
    fails
  - 85 1 parse through local RootsMagic file (after adding matching URIs)
  - 85 0 enable the link to the person's profile page
  - >-
    80 0 bug - Matt's example from raw.githubusercontent renders external links
    that don't work
  - >-
    80 0 try resourceId as an index into the current URI (since the resource
    URIs are now permissioned)
  - 80 1 click on a 4th-gen person and force further expansion
  - 80 1 give example of gedcomx protocol
  - 1 allow direct login to FamilySearch API to retrieve a token
  - >-
    70 1 change family lookup to work from "relationsips" not "display" (or fix
    the latter because "familiesAs..." are arrays)
  - >-
    70 2 update to newer version of d3 (currently 3.5.5, for which it's hard to
    find documentation)
  - add format (mime type?) to otherLocations (maybe)
  - 0 show how the same tree-browsing code can be used in browser & in node
  - add editor? https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-viewer
  - done! prepare demo for IonRev dued:2020-09-20
