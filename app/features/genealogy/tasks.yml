  - 01 fix indentation on setup.js
  - 02 put a button on individuals in genealogy tree to jump to search with that URL id:history-search ref:taskyaml:trentlarson.com,2020/distrinet/histories#external-search

  - 01 type:bug start with test data, go to genealogy, click on the "api" URL for Norman, see that it doesn't show any link back to the original local data set
  - 01 type:bug get test data to show children after focus on Sample Genealogy (and on Elinora); it should because Jed is a child as you can see when editing URL to gedcomx:my-local-test:test-sample-norman#jed (... and note that it doesn't show Jed's name when you paste in Norman's URL)

  - 01 otherLocations is currently inside 'links' (at top level of person) but those are all this format - https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/types/json_HypermediaEnabledData ... so change to a Link type or use 'identifiers' instead - https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/types/json_Subject id:other-locations

  - >-
    01 optimize refreshIfNewer localStorage update by only refreshing those that are newer than the previousMillis
  - 04 work on a real GedcomX (ZIP) file https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/file-format-specification.md
  - refactor getParentsFromFamiliesAsChild to work like getChildrenFromFamiliesAsParent (ie retrieve the local URI and find that person)
  - figure out why local display no longer shows swoop links after half-a-dozen expansions
  - add a "clear cached identities" button for testing; may want to export identities
  - '95 02 make it so that directory URIs work id:#dir-path-uris +genealogy +collaborate' :
    - on a file:///, want to see a link back from the public so add to the MapperBetweenSets when pasting it in
  - pass gedcomx & gedcomxContext to getTrees2 to avoid duplicate parsing
  - figure out why api.familysearch URLs work but www.familysearch URLs don't
  - >-
    93 01 determine problem with parsing JSON on private, eg.
    gedcomx:b2555240-d918-11ea-b21a-5d9a954c8137#norman
  - 90 02 add spinner when loading a new tree
  - '90 02 add tests - find, globalUriForResource, globalUriForId'
  - >-
    90 02 bug - sometimes the graph doesn't show after pasting the URL (after
    cache reload?)
  - for fragments, in getTree2 only make another file/API call if looking into a different base URI (since the data will already be in the current context)
  - >-
    90 02 bug - clicking on otherLocationResource in the same page (repeatedly?)
    fails
  - 85 02 parse through local RootsMagic file (after adding matching URIs)
  - 85 01 enable the link to the person's profile page
  - >-
    80 01 bug - Matt's example from raw.githubusercontent renders external links
    that don't work
  - >-
    80 01 try resourceId as an index into the current URI (since the resource
    URIs are now permissioned)
  - 80 02 click on a 4th-gen person and force further expansion
  - 80 02 give example of gedcomx protocol
  - 1 allow direct login to FamilySearch API to retrieve a token
  - >-
    70 02 change family lookup to work from "relationsips" not "display" (or fix
    the latter because "familiesAs..." are arrays)
  - >-
    70 04 update to newer version of d3 (currently 3.5.5, for which it's hard to
    find documentation)
  - add format (mime type?) to otherLocations (maybe)
  - .5 allow file: URLs to be source IDs (ie. if they're not sharing their data)
  - 01 show how the same tree-browsing code can be used in browser & in node
  - add editor? https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-viewer
  - done! prepare demo for IonRev dued:2020-09-20
