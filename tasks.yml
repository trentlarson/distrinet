tasks :

  - 2 save another local copy of files to track what is most recently seen id:history :
    - multiple files in directories (eg. histories)
      - change the DirectoryDiffPage to work off the cache ID
      - change Array<ChangedFile | null> return type of loadSearchable... if possible
      - is there a difference between setChangesAckedDate and setNotifySourceChanged?
      - change the cache to work off the workUrl? (if not, should make non-workUrls read-only?)
        - remove setSettingsSourceReviewedDate
        - remove setFileNeedsReview?
        - don't make dispatchSetSettingsTextAndYaml reload all, especially inside 'modify'
        - merge dispatchReloadReviewed with convertSourceToInternalFromStorage
      - loop through all files, show each with review & diff buttons
      - only save copies of searchable files
      - change the FileDiffPage back button to go back in history (because it's annoying from the DirectoryDiffPage)
      - review all uses of historyDestFullPathFromUrl to ensure workUrl is appropriate
      - test: if you import a new cache why does it reload notifications when you load again?
    - sharing-app-specific functions :
      - for Syncthing, don't copy but rather look into the .stfolder for history
      - for git, see `git status` for changed files
      - for git, see `git status` for differences from origin
    - do a diff from the source (and not from the in-memory cached copy)
    - when parsing, ensure IRIs are unique
    - when a *.iri diff is detected, make sure there are big warnings
    - for git - look at the origin(s?)

  - 1 define a place for backups, including settings.yml
  - -3 change estimates to hours
    - change forecast equation
  - -1 test all UI functions
  - -2 move genealogy/history/task-list-specific code out of distnet
  - improve diff :
    - cut many lines of same text
    - add a legend (green=insert, red=delete)

  - 1 rename the "urls" arrays to "moreUrls" type:tech-cleanup :
    - migrate existing settings for current users - Mom, Janell, Matt?
  - 0 add option for a single notification for all sources (instead of one for each)
  - -1 make so the IRI column in settings shows (none) & doesn't allow copy when it's blank

  - 2 rename the internal variables type:tech-cleanup
    - id -> iri, idFile -> iriFile, cache sourceId -> sourceIri
    - rename Source "type" to transfer/storage/sharing-type

  - 0 get version call that works for packaged app (important for data migrations)
    (Retrieval from asar?) (Not app.getVersion() - gives electron version)

  - -1 documentation - Google Drive vs Backup

  - 1 make some activities advanced (eg. caching, ID map) and allow disabling at start

  - 0 add dark & light mode for the History page

  - 1 save the local copy (for a given remote URL); only... on setting? :
    - show if there's a difference in the local copy
    - if we ever edit local copy :
      - we retrieve latest from remote & compare to remote

  - 0 totally remove references to any .well-known / wellKnown directory (or allow in advanced settings)

  - -1 distrinet write tests for many setting new settings (to ensure we don't erase settings)
  - 0 encrypt private key
  - 90 1 create list-source directory file that points at other lists of sources
  - 1 button to show memory used by copies (and sources)
  - '90 0 show cached time, both file & memory'
  - >-
    90 0 write version of reloadOneSourceIntoCache that only loads local files
    if the timestamp has changed
  - 1 show tasks as bubbles to visualize the biggest
  - 80 2 change internal settings format = sources & credentials into objects
  - '80 -1 more settings sanity-checking, eg. no duplicate IDs, valid URLs'
  - 80 -2 warn when settings are changed and unsaved
  - >-
    80 0 add warnings for settings, eg. when the ID isn't a global URI (not an
    error)
  - 80 1 package YAML task parsing for npm
  - 80 0 save URI for current task list inside tasks.yml (good for referencing)
  - 80 -1 allow loading of sources automatically (then remove bottom "back" button):
      - add an indicator on the front page that it's loading
      - allow for deselection of files that might be too big
  - -1 type:bug fix where there is still data in the cache after all sources are removed
  - 80 2 mark myself & save my URIs and build functions to relate-to-me
  - 80 0 add the otherLocations to children (so they can show links in the UI)
  - 80 0 avoid 'remote' in multiple files:
    - fix the getStatic to work correctly with the 'app' (via ipcRenderer?) and avoid 'remote'
  - '80 1 tests - missing settings dir & file, empty settings, missing cache dir, missing URLs, multiple OK files':
      - 90 1 handle when load success after save failure or vice versa
  - 80 0 load only smaller (eg. < 5 MB) local files into cache
  - 80 1 save file - find next cache name
  - >-
    80 0 add spinner for the remote file loading (both cache refresh & local
    config)
  - >-
    80 1 allow drag-and-drop to pull a new local file/folder into distnet
    settings
  - 80 1 move feature-specific styling out of app/app.global.css
  - '80 0 on startup, check for files already cached in files and show that date'
  - 80 -1 make some text into static strings (eg "Generate Key" multiple places)
  - '80 -1 in settings, rename source.id to source.uri'
  - 80 1 change most alerts into on-page errors
  - 80 1 upgrade electron version
  - >-
    75 2 start an HTTP server for file access (rather than direct library
    access)
  - 75 0 use logger instead of console.log
  - '75 1 handle YAML TAGs id:yaml-tags'
  - >-
    70 0 use paths.cache instead of paths.config in settings.ts (including path
    check)
  - '70 0 show if cached file already exists, and allow redownload'
  - 70 1 handle timeout failures (tried node-fetch with abort-controller)
  - 70 2 save a preference for loading cache on app start
  - 65 3 package for mobile
  - >-
    65 0 add format (mime type?) info to the sources (for a more accurate
    indicator than just the URI "scheme:") id:source-with-format
  - >-
    60 1 read large files, ie. stream into the cache file & don't load into
    cache if it's too big
  - >-
    50 0 bug - note that the settingsSlice.ts has a bunch of
    eslint-disable-next-line commands that indicate bad practice
  - >-
    50 0 allow blank settings files (which will still allow us to set top-level
    keys if missing) id:set-settings-keys
  - 1 debounce when there are multiple redux 'dispatch' calls at a time (for better performance), eg in dispatchSetSettingsTextAndYaml.
    One approach is https://medium.com/unsplash/react-redux-performance-considerations-when-dispatching-multiple-actions-5162047bf8a6
    ... or create one dispatch method combining multiple.
  - '20 0 read binary files id:read-binary'
  - 20 4 stop requiring semicolons in the code
