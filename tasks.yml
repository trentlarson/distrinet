tasks :

  - -2 move genealogy/history/task-list-specific code out of distnet

  - 1 rename the "urls" arrays to "moreUrls" :
    - migrate existing settings for current users

  - 2 move the settings IDs to a .well-known directory id:well-known :
    - id -> iri, idFile -> iriFile, cache sourceId -> sourceIri
    - rename Source "type" to transfer/storage/sharing-type

  - 0 get version call that works for packaged app

  - 2 save another local copy of files to track what is most recently seen id:#history
    - one file first
      - for git & Syncthing, don't copy but rather look into .stfolder for history
        - ... except for the .well-known/*.iri file(s), if ref:#well-known is done
      - create directory (with any name, maybe based on name of the IRI)
      - store that local directory name in settings in the app "history" directory
    - when parsing, ensure IRIs are unique
    - when a .well-known/*.iri diff is detected, make sure there are big warnings
    - add a column to show if there's a difference from last seen
    - add a button to update the most recent (ie. mark as seen)
    - add a diff function for history

  - 1 save the local copy (for a given remote URL) only... on setting? :
    - show if there's a difference in the local copy
    - if we ever edit local copy :
      - we retrieve latest from remote & compare to remote

  - -1 documentation - Google Drive vs Backup
  - -1 distrinet write tests for many setting new settings (to ensure we don't erase settings)
  - 0 encrypt private key
  - 90 1 create list-source directory file that points at other lists of sources
  - 1 button to show memory used by copies (and sources)
  - '90 0 show cached time, both file & memory'
  - >-
    90 0 write version of reloadOneSourceIntoCache that only loads local files
    if the timestamp has changed
  - 1 show tasks as bubbles to visualize the biggest
  - '85 1 define a place for backups, including settings.yml'

  - >-
    80 0 add warnings for settings, eg. when the ID isn't a global URI (not an
    error)
  - 80 1 package YAML task parsing for npm
  - 80 0 save URI for current task list inside tasks.yml (good for referencing)
  - 80 -1 allow loading of sources automatically (then remove bottom "back" button):
      - add an indicator on the front page that it's loading
      - allow for deselection of files that might be too big
  - -1 type:bug fix where there is still data in the cache after all sources are removed
  - 80 2 mark myself & save my URIs and build functions to relate-to-me
  - 80 0 add the otherLocations to children (so they can show links in the UI)
  - 80 0 avoid 'remote' in multiple files:
    - fix the getStatic to work correctly with the 'app' (via ipcRenderer?) and avoid 'remote'
  - '80 1 tests - missing settings dir & file, empty settings, missing cache dir, missing URLs, multiple OK files':
      - 90 1 handle when load success after save failure or vice versa
  - 80 0 load only smaller (eg. < 5 MB) local files into cache
  - 80 1 save file - find next cache name
  - >-
    80 0 add spinner for the remote file loading (both cache refresh & local
    config)
  - >-
    80 1 allow drag-and-drop to pull a new local file/folder into distnet
    settings
  - 80 1 move feature-specific styling out of app/app.global.css
  - '80 0 on startup, check for files already cached in files and show that date'
  - 80 -1 make some text into static strings (eg "Generate Key" multiple places)
  - '80 -1 in settings, rename source.id to source.uri'
  - 80 1 change all alerts into on-page errors
  - 80 1 upgrade electron version
  - >-
    75 2 start an HTTP server for file access (rather than direct library
    access)
  - 75 0 use logger instead of console.log
  - '75 1 handle YAML TAGs id:yaml-tags'
  - >-
    70 0 use paths.cache instead of paths.config in settings.ts (including path
    check)
  - '70 0 show if cached file already exists, and allow redownload'
  - 70 1 handle timeout failures (tried node-fetch with abort-controller)
  - 70 1 show indicator if settings file has been changed
  - 70 2 save a preference for loading cache on app start
  - 65 3 package for mobile
  - >-
    65 0 add format (mime type?) info to the sources (for a more accurate
    indicator than just the URI "scheme:") id:source-with-format
  - >-
    60 1 read large files, ie. stream into the cache file & don't load into
    cache if it's too big
  - >-
    50 0 bug - note that the settingsSlice.ts has a bunch of
    eslint-disable-next-line commands that indicate bad practice
  - >-
    50 0 allow blank settings files (which will still allow us to set top-level
    keys if missing) id:set-settings-keys
  - 1 debounce when there are multiple redux 'dispatch' calls at a time (for better performance), eg in dispatchSetSettingsTextAndYaml.
    One approach is https://medium.com/unsplash/react-redux-performance-considerations-when-dispatching-multiple-actions-5162047bf8a6
    ... or create one dispatch method combining multiple.
  - '20 0 read binary files id:read-binary'
  - 20 4 stop requiring semicolons in the code
