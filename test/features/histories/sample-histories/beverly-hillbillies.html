Come and listen to my story about a man named

Jed,
</span>
a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed.
And then one day he was shootin at some food
and up through the ground come a bubblin crude.

</p>
<p>

Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea.

</p>
<p>

Well the first thing you know ol Jed's a millionaire.
The kinfolk said "Jed move away from there".
Said "Californy is the place you ought to be"
so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly.

</p>
<p>

Hills, that is. Swimmin pools, movie stars.
